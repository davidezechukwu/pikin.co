## Built with Migration to Angular v20 

## This is an example of a modern React application written in TypeScript, demonstrating a clean, type-safe codebase and a mobile-first, fully responsive UI. It is architected for parallel development, with the UX showing how contract-driven JSON mocks could be used to allow multiple Database, API and UX teams to build features independently against a stable API schema. The UX service layer abstracts data access behind mock implementations, and are architected to allow for easy switch over to real HTTP calls as soon as back-end endpoints go live. It can also serve as an E2E Test Double Deployed on Ubuntu with Nginx, it leverages production-grade build optimizationsâ€”Brotli/Gzip compression, code splitting, lazy loading, and HTTP/2 serving. The folder structure and feature modules keep teams from colliding: each domain owns its components, models, services, and mocks in clearly defined boundaries.


### Run locally as you would run any Angular project using ng serve.
